# Tigrigna Spell Checker Documentation

## Overview

This is a real-time spell checker for the Tigrigna language built with Python, Jupyter Notebook, and interactive widgets. The application provides basic error detection and correction suggestions for Tigrigna text input. The system uses a dictionary-based approach, comparing input text against a predefined lexicon of Tigrigna words.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The Tigrigna Spell Checker uses a simple, modular architecture:

1. **Core Components**: 
   - A Python-based spell checking engine (`TigrignaSpellChecker` class)
   - A Jupyter Notebook interface for real-time interaction
   - A dictionary/lexicon of Tigrigna words

2. **Technology Stack**:
   - Python 3.11+ as the programming language
   - Jupyter Notebook for the interactive interface
   - pandas for data management
   - ipywidgets for interactive UI elements

3. **Architecture Pattern**:
   The application follows a simple, modular design where the spell-checking logic is isolated in a utility class and the interactive interface is built in the Jupyter Notebook.

## Key Components

### 1. TigrignaSpellChecker Class

Located in `utils/spell_checker.py`, this is the core component that handles:
- Loading the Tigrigna word dictionary
- Providing methods to check spelling
- Offering correction suggestions for misspelled words

The class is designed to be imported and used within the Jupyter notebook interface. It appears to be incomplete in the current implementation, with some methods like `add_to_dictionary()` not fully implemented.

### 2. Dictionary Data

The application uses a simple text file (`data/tigrigna_words.txt`) as its lexicon, containing common Tigrigna words, one per line. This dictionary is loaded by the spell checker during initialization.

### 3. Jupyter Notebook Interface

The `tigrigna_spell_checker.ipynb` notebook serves as the interactive interface, importing the spell checker utility and providing a real-time environment for text checking.

## Data Flow

1. **Dictionary Loading**: On initialization, the `TigrignaSpellChecker` class loads Tigrigna words from the dictionary file into memory.

2. **User Interaction**: 
   - User enters Tigrigna text through the Jupyter notebook interface
   - The input is processed in real-time
   
3. **Spell Checking Process**:
   - Text is tokenized into individual words
   - Each word is checked against the dictionary
   - Misspelled words are identified
   - Correction suggestions are generated for misspelled words
   
4. **Result Display**:
   - Misspelled words are highlighted in the interface
   - Correction suggestions are displayed to the user

## External Dependencies

The project relies on the following Python packages:
- pandas (for data management)
- ipywidgets (for interactive UI elements)
- Jupyter (for the notebook environment)

No external APIs or services are used; the spell checker operates independently with its internal dictionary.

## Deployment Strategy

The application is deployed as a Jupyter Notebook server:

1. **Local Development**: Run using standard Jupyter Notebook commands
2. **Replit Deployment**: Uses the configuration in `.replit` to:
   - Install required dependencies
   - Start a Jupyter Notebook server on port 5000
   - Make the notebook available for interaction

The deployment is lightweight and stateless, requiring only the Python runtime and necessary packages.

## Development Roadmap

Based on the current implementation, these areas could be developed further:

1. **Complete spell checking implementation**: Finish methods in the `TigrignaSpellChecker` class
2. **Enhance the dictionary**: Expand the Tigrigna word list for better coverage
3. **Improve suggestion algorithm**: Implement more sophisticated methods for generating correction suggestions
4. **Add user dictionary**: Allow users to add custom words to the dictionary
5. **Implement performance optimizations**: For handling larger texts more efficiently

## Limitations

- The current dictionary is limited in size
- The spell checker likely uses simple edit distance for suggestions rather than context-aware corrections
- The system doesn't account for morphological complexity of the Tigrigna language
